# Sales-Analysis
Various Data analysis projects

For Project 1, please download "names.csv" and "sales.csv" to your working directory. This project analyzes profits from a band fundraiser based on student and instrument.

For Project 2, please download "divvy.csv" to your working directory. This is the full rental data for Chicago's "divvy" bikes for one year, which I parsed and performed various analyses on. This will output to a new file, rather than your console

For project 3, please download "avocados.csv" to your working directory. This is a csv with data on avocado prices in multiple cities for a year to analyze and visualize sales information across the cities.
